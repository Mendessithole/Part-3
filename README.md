Issues Encountered
1. Error: type does not contain a definition for name
Problem: This error occurred due to an incorrect reference to a model property. For example, I mistakenly referred to a property named name in a model that did not contain such a property.
Solution: The issue was resolved by correctly referring to the properties in the model that actually existed, such as LecturerName, LecturerSurname, Programme, etc.
2. Misalignment between UI and Backend Code
Problem: Initially, the UI design in the Razor view did not match the backend model, causing errors when submitting the form.
Solution: I updated the Razor view to correctly bind the form fields to the model properties and adjusted the model to include all necessary properties.
3. Form Submission Issues
Problem: The form was not submitting correctly due to missing or incorrect form field names and model binding issues.
Solution: I ensured that all form fields were properly named and bound to the correct model properties. Additionally, I added necessary validations to prevent submission of incomplete forms.
